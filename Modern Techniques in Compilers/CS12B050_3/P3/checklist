Checklist for Assignment P3

Q.) Have you named your main program as P3.java, that can be compiled with javac?
Yes.
Q.) Does your P3.java take input from the Standard Input (System.in)?
Yes.
Q.) Does your P3.java give output to the Standard Output (System.out)?
Yes.
Q.) Have you removed all the debugging messages that your program may output? (Output of System.err isn't considered, and thus maybe kept)
Yes.
Q.) Have you removed all the binaries, .jar and .class files from your project?
Yes.
Q.) Is P3 the immediate parent of P3.java?
Yes.
Q.) Is this checklist a file in P3?
Yes.
Q.) Have you named your project directory as XXXXXXXX (your eight digit roll number in CAPITAL), and is P3 a part of it?
Yes.
Q.) Have you tar+gzipped the project directory as XXXXXXXX.P3.tar.gz?
Yes.
Q.) Is (some part of) your assignment plagiarized?
No.
Any assumptions that you made in the implementation:
No negative numbers. That is int in the assignment I
have assumed to be unsigned int.

The minimal optimizations which I have done are
a*0 = 0 and a&false = false.

1) Java code - deadlock / race conditions.
2) c/c++ memory leak.
3) Fragile base class problem ? c++. Development time is high.
Because recompilation is required for every classes.
4) Compile time vs Link time vs runtime dependency.
A cannot be compiled without B. Seperate compilation is when
they can be compiled separately but object files should be linked.
Compile time dependencies should be avoided. If A derives from B then
they are run time dependent not compile time dependent
5) Coupling or cohesion.
Functional -> Sequential -> Communicational -> temporal (desirable).
logical -> procedural -> coincidental (undesirable).
content -> common -> control -> stamp (desirable).
data (undesirable).
set jump long jump are pathological couplings.
Intersection of the slice of all the output variables should be 30%
generally. If it is zero it is a bad design.

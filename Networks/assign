5. Experiment with filters: Filters are extremely powerful and can simplify analysis if used intelli- gently; Here is an example:
tcp && not ssh && (ip.src == 10.6.16.244 || ip.dst == 74.123.4.23)
List any two filters your tried along with snapshots of the output.

tcp && not ssh && (ip.src == 10.6.15.92 && ip.dst == 10.22.21.249)
Anoher packet search filter was used where we matched data strings
with FF D8 FF E0.

This Assignment made me learn TCP versions better and
I had reasonable amount of fun implementing my own version.

The marking of points (like Slow start etc) could have been restricted
to only one image file instead of marking for every file which makes this
assignment tedious.

The amount of time spent on rerunning the code is quite high.
If there is a smarter way of doing it it could be mentioned.
